## Technical Stack

- **Frontend: React and Redux**
  - The frontend of this app is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Redux is employed for state management, providing a centralized and predictable way to manage application state.

- **Backend: Express.js**
  - Our server-side is powered by Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express serves as the bridge between the frontend and the database, handling API requests and logic.

- **User Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
  - User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure, stateless authentication for our users. JWT tokens are issued upon successful login and used for user authorization.

- **Payment Processing: Stripe**
  - The app integrates Stripe, a widely trusted payment gateway, to enable online payments. Stripe ensures smooth, secure, and seamless transactions, allowing users to purchase a variety of products from electronics to clothing.

## Key Features

### Secure User Authentication

- **JWT-Driven Authentication**: Upon successful registration or login, users receive a JWT token. This token is required for authorized access to various parts of the app, providing a secure and seamless user experience.

### Dynamic Product Catalog

- **Diverse Product Categories**: Explore a wide range of products, from electronics to clothing. Our dynamic catalog is organized into categories, allowing users to easily find and select products of interest.

### Shopping Cart and Checkout

- **Intuitive Cart Management**: Users can add products to their shopping cart, review cart contents, and easily remove items. Our app provides a smooth shopping experience with real-time updates.

- **Secure Payment Processing**: With Stripe integration, users can securely pay for their selected items online. Stripe handles payment processing, making it a reliable choice for both customers and sellers.

### State Management with Redux

- **Centralized State**: Redux centralizes application state management, ensuring a predictable and manageable state for complex interactions within the app.

- **Real-time Updates**: Redux facilitates real-time updates of cart contents, product availability, and user interactions, enhancing the overall user experience.
